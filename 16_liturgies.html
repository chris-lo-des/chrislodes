      <h1 class="title">Liturgies for Hope</h1>
      <p>
        Amidst the 2020 shutdown, the Creative team at my church released a
        series of Liturgies "for Hope," intended as a steadying, shared prayers
        for a moment of "frightening headlines, unhelpful think pieces, and
        mindless escapism." I helped conceptualize and design an identity for
        the collection of liturgies, extending to a color-changing website, and
        a series of printable pdfs (offered for download with each liturgy)
        <br /><br />

        Visual inspiration for this came from an ineffable sense of something
        printed ten years ago—that poem your mom had photocopied from the
        library and taped to a mirror ten years ago… or an old book filled to
        the brim with handwritten notes. Like those warping, fading pieces of
        paper, we wished for our liturgies to be something familiar and
        bright—easy to return to. The web design is meant to be content and
        legibility-first, with modest design choices to support a sense of
        print-like physicality and timelessness.

        Color choices were informed by a bright and varied late 20th-century
        palette, inspired by modernist optimism, pastel photocopy paper, and the
        1980s packaging of Japanese food bar CalorieMate. The final color
        selection for each liturgy was drawn from Dictionary of Color
        Combinations, originally published by designer Sanzo Wada in the 1930s
        (available at Printed Matter here). Each liturgy’s background animates
        between two colors in a steadying rhythm of hue and tone.
        <br /><br />For typefaces, EB Garamond provides stolid (and open-source)
        legibility, while a handwritten typeface gives it a warm human touch
        beyond the margins. This typeface—Shake—was created from the real,
        shaking handwriting of the designer’s mother, and published to raise
        awareness for her and all patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.
        Its hopeful warmth feels perfect for a moment where the world itself
        feels a little sick and shaky.

        itself has unfortunately deprecated.
