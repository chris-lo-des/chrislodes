					 This Must Be Stronger Than That 
				</p>
				<p>
					In a world of increasing hardness and cruelty, what does it mean to live a life of disciplined spiritual strength? <i>This Must Be Stronger Than That</i> was an eleven-week sermon series headed by Jon Tyson at Church of the City New York, inspired by the rigor and legacy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's <i>Finkenwalde</i> Seminary. Each week describes a spiritual discipline as a duality where [this] must be stronger than [that], and was intended as a grounding call to action in the midst of a busy New York City congregation.
				</p>
				<p>
					To facilitate visual expression of the series, I set up a loose system of rules meant to exphasize a humble grit, grounded in daily practice. Each duality was expressed in dynamic compositions of hand-drawn type and referential textures, layered on a rigid core template. Then, as a final layer of interpretation, each composition was output as a multi-color risograph print, scanned, and reworked for use in presentations, static/animated assets for social media usage, and a custom-coded "facilitator guide" website. To encourage action, I made 700 double-sided riso prints a week as handouts to the congregation, each with a relevant assignment on the back to encourage application.
				</p>

					「&nbsp;Dual<span class="fwid">i</span>ty Compos<span class="fwid">i</span>t<span class="fwid">i</span>ons&nbsp;」
				</h1>
				<br><br>

				<p>
					Though the word "discipline" conjures up images of restrictive tedium or ritualistic ascetism, our goal was to show spiritual discipline as life-giving and accessible practice. I created a "core template" based on a bifurcation of each composition into "this" on one side and "that" on the other, then worked with friend and artist Eugene to layer on top the core template as a raw canvas. The final compositions feature hand-drawn type, texture, and other illustrative references spanning art history, theological tradition, and the textures of everyday New York life. <br><br>

					Each of the final eleven compositions is shown below, with a short description explaining some of the layered references.

《 Process / Other Deliverables 》</b>
					</h1>
					<br><br>

				<p>
					Each week, I worked with close friend/collaborator Eugene Kim to create lettering, texture, and drawn assets that would inform the week's composition. I would manipulate scans and photos of these originals into final form, then print/translate each through a risograph printer, which lent a natural analog noise and bright colors to the final output.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Risograph allows out-of-gamut colors like fluorescent pinks and yellows, the compositions were eye catching if nothing else, but also fresh in a visual environment of browns and black/white photos common to Church of the City New York. I got a kick of watching one kid examine his handout for about 10 minutes, rubbing the ink as he tried to figure out how it was printed. 
				</p>
				<img class="bodyimg" src="img/tt16.jpg">
				<img class="bodyimg" src="img/tt17.jpg">
				<img class="bodyimg" src="img/tt18.jpg">
				<p>		
					To support individual discipline, Each week's content ended with a call to practice, printed for later review on the back of paper handouts. Each handout included (on one side) the cover slide for the week, (on the other) a weekly prompt for individual application, and space for notes. I printed 700 copies each week as double-sided, two-color prints at SVA's RisoLab on 3-up, Tabloid sheets. Final cards were cut to size by guillotine in 12 batches, to account for the natural creep of the Risograph printer.
				</p>
				<p>		
					A weekly slide, social media assets, and an animated bumper were based on a scan of these weekly handouts, which I would resize for final use or sample and animate in After Effects.

				<p>	I also created a custom Facilitator's guide website for this series, which would host questions, suggested activities, and further resources for the various discussion groups throughout the church's community. The website was built off a Cargo site with custom-injected css and html. I worked with Laura Cave, Jon Tyson, and Suzy Rojas to generate, maintain, and update the site on a weekly basis <a href="thismustbestrongerthanthat.com">visit the site here</a> or view the iframe below.

<b>《 Concept 》
					<br><br>
				</b></h1>

				<p>
					The series was inspired by a conversation theologian Bonhoeffer had with a friend worried about the intensity of his seminary's emphasis spiritual practice. Bonhoeffer rowed his friend across a river to contrast their small seminary to the training grounds of the Nazi air force close by. He then spoke … "of a new generation of Germans in  training, whose discipline [was being formed] 'for a kingdom … of hardness and cruelty.' It would be necessary, he explained, to propose a superior discipline if the Nazis were to be defeated." This (the seminary) would have to be stronger that That (The Nazis)

				<!-- <h3 class="bodycaption"> "That" – Luftwaffe day parade in front of the Reich Air Ministry, 1 March 1939. </h3> -->
				<p>
					Based off this context, I saw the series as discipline-focused call to action, inspired by a dark historical moment. It would need to be grounded in historicity, urgency, and placed in an immediate, modern context. The challenge would be to create a visual system that captured all this in a grit injected in daily life; to show discipline not just as a concept—but in situ, propelled by consistent urgency.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>In this interest, I developed two guiding design principles:</u></b>
					<br><br>
					<b>&#9758; Grit/Grounding</b> in layered texture—creating a sense of history, and gesturing towards everyday, down-to-earth action.
					<br><br>
					<b>&#9758; Humility</b> through low-fidelity design choices. The end visual would be beautiful and weathered in devotion, yet accessibel and transparent in method of creation—not filtered through exclusive programs and intellect
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><u>These principles informed four strong visual elements</u></b>
					<br><br>
					<b>&#9758; Sidewalk as "ground"</b> Each asset was textured using a photo of the sidewalk outside my door. This allows the designs for a modern, New-York based church to be informed by the literal backdrop and recorded history of New York's gum-stained concrete.
					<img class="inlimg" src="img/tt12_A_sidewalk.jpg">
					<br><br>
					<b>&#9758; Handwriting as typeface</b> as an accessible, expressive, and low-fidelity method of communicating abstract concepts like "Hospitality" or "Hate."
					<img class="inlimg" src="img/tt13_B_handwriting.jpg">
					<br><br>
					<b>&#9758; Any Everyday Typeface (Arial)</b> enforcing ease and humility of form
					<img class="inlimg" src="img/tt15_D_Arial.jpg">
					<br><br>
					<b>&#9758; A rigid cover template</b> that allowed for free expression, but accessible consistency week-to-week.
					<img class="inlimg" src="img/tt14_C_template.jpg">

					<br><br>
				</b></h1>

				<p>
				Doing anything of this scale for a sustained 11 weeks turned out to be a larger undertaking than I thought. The original system was well-researched and conceptually grounded, but rather quickly thrown together with less visual development than I would have preferred. All told, in coordinating originals, scanning and compositing, splitting colors (risograph requires black and white files like a screenprint), printing, cutting, scanning, updating, and animating… this amounted to at least 11 hours of work a week. I still find it a  miracle that I managed to juggle all this without losing freshness or cogency.

				That said, it wasn't always the best feeling to see it end in 30 seconds of projection and handouts discarded on the ground.
				<br><br>
				But in smaller ways, feedback from the church was effusive. Many community group leaders  lauded the website as an essential, functional resource for running weekly meetings. Some friends collected bulletins and bugged me for extras when they missed weeks. Others pointed out the art history references on instagram. Perhaps best of all, the series served as a sort of beacon for different designers and artists who it felt like came out of the woodwork, curious to learn more about the process and intent.  
				<br><br>
				In the end, the greatest surprise was the resonance of such an abstract visual system to with a diverse, 700-person audience spread across New York City. Watching a kid observe my prints so carefully gave me hope that the impact was more than flashy colors.
