      <p>
        Over a six-month engagement, SYP helped Target develop a framework for
        culture that could bridge corporate and field employees with shared
        language around vision, values, and leadership. As part of the rollout,
        we created digital and physical tools which reinforced the new culture.
        This included 800 custom-made kits for a virtual leadership meeting and
        2,000 “culture kits” sent to leaders of all Targets retail locations and
        distribution centers, touching 350,000 employees.
        <br /><br />
        As creative lead on the project, I guided all visual output for both
        phases of work. This included experience design for key meetings and
        events, visual direction for the culture framework launch, and
        collaboration with clients and vendors for design and production of both
        physical kits.

      <p>
        Target has a long history of design, with pioneering approaches to
        designer partnerships and a portfolio of unique internal brands. To
        create something accompanying Target's new vision for culture, we wanted
        to push into something future-facing that would still feel drawn from
        core identity elements.
        <br /><br />
        The design process thus began with visual research, synthesizing the
        heart of what made something feel ‘Target.’ In ensuing weeks, we tried
        to draw from this research to express the culture vision “we care, grow,
        and win together.”

      <p>
        Pretty quickly, I settled on a visual system that used small illustrated
        "fruit stickers" as central visual in each composition. I reached out to
        some talented illustrators from the church community and commissioned a
        weekly sticker, each themed around a related verse. Each ilustration
        would include lettering for the fruit of the week, references to related
        Scipture, and any illustration. Prompting and feedback was as loose as
        possible to maintain a diversity of visual elements and styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a neutral backdrop and type system turned out to be quite
        challenge. I needed something that wouldn't draw too much attention away
        from ther sticker, but still successfully communicated the theme. I
        experimented with a number of different type treatments and background
        styles inspired by fruiit and food labeling, but quickly found that
        anyuthing too literal or graphic ended up pretty distracting. Blank
        color fields in a digital environment also proved dimensionless in a
        digital context, and there were only so many free macro fruit pictures I
        could find online…

        <br />
        The final concept draws from circles and patterns of Target to express
        key components of the new culture we were trying to reinforce. Die-cut
        holes suggest how the framework is a reframing focus on reinforcing
        existing Target behaviors, while a pattern of growing dots serves as
        both literal expression of the Vision and a reference to a Target cart
        design.<br /><br />

        We used this approach and visual elements for various deliverables over
        the course of the second phase, including physical kits, digital
        leadership tools, and presentations for meetings with internal
        stakeholders.
        <br /><br />

        The most complicated deliverable was a kit sent to 800 key leaders for a
        virtual summit we helped design. We developed design the box’s contents,
        and helped brainstorm relevant gifts and tools sent to leaders.
        <br /><br />
        A key aspect of our designed experience was a moment of “culture
        sightings,” where we’d ask leaders to take five minutes to write a
        physical or virtual letter to a team member they’d noticed living this
        value. To support this, we designed and produced a small stationery kit
        with branded notecards, stickers, and pre-stamped envelopes.
        <br /><br />
        The kit also included a letter from the CEO, a glass dome “magnifier”
        (as memento for the idea of “culture sightings”), a small booklet of
        prompts used during the session, and a selection of snacks from
        Target-supported Black-owned businesses.

        The final stickers feature illustrations from friends Jenice Kim,
        Margaret Lin, Judd Smith, and Dan Cho. Each was interspersed in sermon
        presentations, social media assets, and a custom-coded webpage for each
        week's discussion guide.
