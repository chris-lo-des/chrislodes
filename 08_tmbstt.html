      <h1 class="title MED">This Must Be Stronger Than That</h1>

      <p>
        In a world of increasing hardness and cruelty, what does it mean to live
        a life of disciplined spiritual strength?
        <i>This Must Be Stronger Than That</i> was an eleven-week sermon series
        headed by Jon Tyson at Church of the City New York, inspired by the
        rigor and legacy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's <i>Finkenwalde</i> Seminary.
        Each week describes a spiritual discipline as a duality where [this]
        must be stronger than [that], and was intended as a grounding call to
        action in the midst of a busy New York City congregation. <br /><br />

        To facilitate visual expression of the series, I set up a loose system
        of rules meant to exphasize a humble grit, grounded in daily practice.
        Each duality was expressed in dynamic compositions of hand-drawn type
        and referential textures, layered on a rigid core template. Then, as a
        final layer of interpretation, each composition was output as a
        multi-color risograph print, scanned, and reworked for use in
        presentations, static/animated assets for social media usage, and a
        custom-coded "facilitator guide" website. To encourage action, I made
        700 double-sided riso prints a week as handouts to the congregation,
        each with a relevant assignment on the back to encourage application.
      </p>

      </h1>

      <p>
        Though the word "discipline" conjures up images of restrictive tedium or
        ritualistic ascetism, our goal was to show spiritual discipline as
        life-giving and accessible practice. I created a "core template" based
        on a bifurcation of each composition into "this" on one side and "that"
        on the other, then worked with friend and artist Eugene to layer on top
        the core template as a raw canvas. The final compositions feature
        hand-drawn type, texture, and other illustrative references spanning art
        history, theological tradition, and the textures of everyday New York
        life. <br /><br />

        Each of the final eleven compositions is shown below, with a short
        description explaining some of the layered references.

      <p>
        Each week, I worked with close friend/collaborator Eugene Kim to create
        lettering, texture, and drawn assets that would inform the week's
        composition. I would manipulate scans and photos of these originals into
        final form, then print/translate each through a risograph printer, which
        lent a natural analog noise and bright colors to the final output.
        <br /><br />
        Since Risograph allows out-of-gamut colors like fluorescent pinks and
        yellows, the compositions were eye catching if nothing else, but also
        fresh in a visual environment of browns and black/white photos common to
        Church of the City New York. I got a kick of watching one kid examine
        his handout for about 10 minutes, rubbing the ink as he tried to figure
        out how it was printed.

        <br />
        To support individual discipline, Each week's content ended with a call
        to practice, printed for later review on the back of paper handouts.
        Each handout included (on one side) the cover slide for the week, (on
        the other) a weekly prompt for individual application, and space for
        notes. I printed 700 copies each week as double-sided, two-color prints
        at SVA's RisoLab on 3-up, Tabloid sheets. Final cards were cut to size
        by guillotine in 12 batches, to account for the natural creep of the
        Risograph printer.
        <br /><br />
        A weekly slide, social media assets, and an animated bumper were based
        on a scan of these weekly handouts, which I would resize for final use
        or sample and animate in After Effects.

        I also created a custom Facilitator's guide website for this series,
        which would host questions, suggested activities, and further resources
        for the various discussion groups throughout the church's community. The
        website was built off a Cargo site with custom-injected css and html. I
        worked with Laura Cave, Jon Tyson, and Suzy Rojas to generate, maintain,
        and update the site on a weekly basis

      <h1 class="MED">《 Concept 》</h1>

      <p>
        The series was inspired by a conversation theologian Bonhoeffer had with
        a friend worried about the intensity of his seminary's emphasis
        spiritual practice. Bonhoeffer rowed his friend across a river to
        contrast their small seminary to the training grounds of the Nazi air
        force close by. He then spoke … "of a new generation of Germans in
        training, whose discipline [was being formed] 'for a kingdom … of
        hardness and cruelty.' It would be necessary, he explained, to propose a
        superior discipline if the Nazis were to be defeated." This (the
        seminary) would have to be stronger that That (The Nazis)
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      />
      <!-- <h3 class="bodycaption"> "That" – Luftwaffe day parade in front of the Reich Air Ministry, 1 March 1939. </h3> -->
      <p>
        Based off this context, I saw the series as discipline-focused call to
        action, inspired by a dark historical moment. It would need to be
        grounded in historicity, urgency, and placed in an immediate, modern
        context. The challenge would be to create a visual system that captured
        all this in a grit injected in daily life; to show discipline not just
        as a concept—but in situ, propelled by consistent urgency.
        <br /><br /><br />
        In this interest, I developed <u>two guiding design principles:</u>
        <br /><br />
        <b>&#9758; Grit/Grounding</b> in layered texture—creating a sense of
        history, and gesturing towards everyday, down-to-earth action.
        <br /><br />
        <b>&#9758; Humility</b> through low-fidelity design choices. The end
        visual would be beautiful and weathered in devotion, yet accessibel and
        transparent in method of creation—not filtered through exclusive
        programs and intellect <br /><br /><br />
        These principles informed <u>four strong visual elements:</u>
        <br /><br />
        <b>&#9758; Sidewalk as "ground"</b> Each asset was textured using a
        photo of the sidewalk outside my door. This allows the designs for a
        modern, New-York based church to be informed by the literal backdrop and
        recorded history of New York's gum-stained concrete.
        <br />
        <img class="MED inl" src="img/08_tmbstt/tt12_A_sidewalk.jpg" />
        <br />
        <b>&#9758; Handwriting as typeface</b> as an accessible, expressive, and
        low-fidelity method of communicating abstract concepts like
        "Hospitality" or "Hate."
        <br />
        <img class="MED inl" src="img/08_tmbstt/tt13_B_handwriting.jpg" />
        <br />
        <b>&#9758; Any Everyday Typeface (Arial)</b> enforcing ease and humility
        of form
        <br />
        <img class="MED inl" src="img/08_tmbstt/tt15_D_Arial.jpg" />
        <br />
        <b>&#9758; A rigid cover template</b> that allowed for free expression,
        but accessible consistency week-to-week.
        <br />
        <img class="MED inl" src="img/08_tmbstt/tt14_C_template.jpg" />

        This is honestly the short version. For more on the concept and what
        inspiration I drew from, read the longform in my pitch deck

      <h1 class="MED">《 Closing Thoughts&nbsp;》</h1>

      <p>
        Doing anything of this scale for a sustained 11 weeks turned out to be a
        larger undertaking than I thought. The original system was
        well-researched and conceptually grounded, but rather quickly thrown
        together with less visual development than I would have preferred. All
        told, in coordinating originals, scanning and compositing, splitting
        colors (risograph requires black and white files like a screenprint),
        printing, cutting, scanning, updating, and animating… this amounted to
        at least 11 hours of work a week. I still find it a miracle that I
        managed to juggle all this without losing freshness or cogency.

        <br />
        That said, it wasn't always the best feeling to see it end in 30 seconds
        of projection and handouts discarded on the ground.
        <br /><br />
        But in smaller ways, feedback from the church was effusive. Many
        community group leaders lauded the website as an essential, functional
        resource for running weekly meetings. Some friends collected bulletins
        and bugged me for extras when they missed weeks. Others pointed out the
        art history references on instagram. Perhaps best of all, the series
        served as a sort of beacon for different designers and artists who it
        felt like came out of the woodwork, curious to learn more about the
        process and intent.
        <br /><br />
        In the end, the greatest surprise was the resonance of such an abstract
        visual system to with a diverse, 700-person audience spread across New
        York City. Watching a kid observe my prints so carefully gave me hope
        that the impact was more than flashy colors.
