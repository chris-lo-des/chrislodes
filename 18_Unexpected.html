      <h1 class="MED title">Unexpected Jesus</h1>
      <p>
        Unexpected Jesus was a series about encounter and expectation, examining
        what happen when God meets man.
        <br /><br />
        The result, in summary, is "glorious explosion." In encounters with
        lepers, Jews, Pharisees… we find Jesus bursting apart preconceptions and
        worldly systems. Trailing in His wake, we find peeople transfigured—from
        blind to seeing, isolation to community, fishermen to fishers of men. To
        encounter God's presence is to encounter combustion—a fire refing,
        consuming, and enduring. His true presence should leave Christians like
        the disciples ont eh road ot Emmaeus, with hearts burning.
        <br /><br />
        The visual concept for this series thus aims to express the fiery
        aspects of Jesus' encounters with man. How does He isnpire and provoke
        us? What is consumed in full, and what is left behind?
      </p>
      <h1>「&nbsp;Inspiration 1: Cold, Dark, Matter&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        Cornelia Parker's work <i>Cold Dark Matter</i> was made at a time where
        explosions seemed to pop up everywhere in pop culture, from cartoons to
        news reports of domestic terrorism to militarization in the UK. With
        Army Corps, she detonated a garden shed, collected the charred debris,
        and suspended them—as if mid-explosion—around a single lightbulb. The
        resulting instlalation is a striking examination of domestic ideals,
        imagery, and spaces now brutally transformed. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <img class="MED" src="img/18_Unexpected/IMG_20200103_150524.jpg" />
      <p>
        <br />
        For Christians, sometimes I think when Jesus knocks on the front door,
        it's easier to bring him around to the backyard shed. We recongize that
        he wants to work in our hearts, but we'd rather he do all his redeeming
        work somewhere that matters a little less to us, stored neatly in boxes
        of religiosity. The Light of Christ can only exceed these shadows by
        their nature.
        <br /><br />
        What would it look like when God explodes our quiet homes, that we may
        build a house for him?
      </p>
      <h1>「&nbsp;Inspiration 2: Fireworks&nbsp;」</h1>
      <p>
        I think the immediate temptation with combustion might be leaning too
        far into destruction. Throughout the Bible we see exmples of God's glory
        exploding in terrifying power—the mountain smokes, fire consumes Aaron's
        sons, and Israel falls to the ground in worship… but it doesn't feel
        right to characterize these explosions as wanton or sadistic. Just as
        God's plagues to teh world are sings and wonders to his people, his
        encounters annuhilate our earthly flesh, yet catalyze the birth of new
        life.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <img class="MED" src="img/18_Unexpected/UJ_001.png" />
      <p>
        <br />
        In this respect, perhaps a more wonderful explosion would be a firework.
        Drawing from the works of aritsts like Cai Guo-Qiang, Takashi Murakami,
        and countless rom-com anime… what would it look like to create a
        celebratory explosion, which communicate sboth the intimacy of encounter
        and awe-inspiring might?
      </p>

      <h1>
        「&nbsp;Exploration 1: Ampersands, Pucker and Bloat Effect&nbsp;」
      </h1>

      <p>
        As I started mockup slides, I began to type out pairings of Jesus'
        encounters. "THE UNEXPECTED JESUS / AND / THE SAMARITAN WOMAN" It struck
        me that the "and" in these phrases drew us in connection to God. I began
        experimenting with different ways of distorting ampersands which in
        themselves began to express both the explosion of a reaction linked ot
        its original meaning as a shortened conjunction.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <img class="LRG" src="img/18_Unexpected/UJ_002.png" />
      <p>
        <br />
        Thus, at its atomic level the series could be a celebration of Jesus
        <i>and</i> us. That which connects him to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,
        Peter, and the Samaritan Woman is offered freely to us. Our
        preconceptions can only burst open as old wineskins, yet expectantly as
        a tearing of the curtain, fireworks in teh background of a romantic
        comeday. And now, standing above th ewreckage of our tidy, domestic shed
        is Him with face radiant, to offer us all the terrifying and cathartic
        depth of a reationship with the living God—the living <i>God</i> who
        beckons us dance with the same power that created the universe and now
        somehow burns our hearts. The Unexpected Jesus loves us.
      </p>

      <h1>「&nbsp;Exploration 2: Color / Light Effects&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        I briefly toyed witht eh idea of some highly saturated compostions
        before landing on a final direction more reminiscent of a true firework.
        Bty applying feather, blur, and glow effects I found it was pretty easy
        to generate a dynamic explosion with a few layered vectors.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <img class="LRG" src="img/18_Unexpected/UJ_003.png" />
      <div class="minispacer"></div>
      <p class="MED">
        <br />
        Since the base vector could be anything, I began to experiment with
        "exploding" various cions. Icons in modern using—origianlly intended as
        a "univeral language" stemming from Bauhaus and modernist
        philosophies—themselves are flat simplifications fo broad and complex
        obhjects. If a set of thematic icons could be sourced each week, it felt
        appropriate to use them as a representation of our earthly expectations,
        now suberted and exceeded by divine presence.
        <br /><br />
        As a final touch, I designed each week's title text as a mask of the
        background. Thus the title can only be revealed by explosive encounter.
        <br /><br />

      <h1>
        《&nbsp;F<span class="fwid">i</span>NAL CONCEPT (ART<span class="fwid"
          >i</span
        >ST STATEMENT)&nbsp;》
      </h1>

      <p>
        Over the length of the series, "Unexpected Jesus" was visualized as an
        eight-part fireworks display. Each week, icons were selected to
        represent the theme, then manipulated into an animated explosion. In
        this way, images that represent human, simple expectations of Jesus are
        overwhelmed into brilliant displays of light. <br /><br />
        Alongside the thematic fireworks, explosions based on an ampersand (&)
        shape celebrated the conjunction "and" that ties the God of the Bible
        with His people and His Church, referencing the roots of all revelation
        within relationship.
        <br /><br />
        Our conceptions, like unexploded firecrackers, often hint little at the
        true nature of a living Christ. It is only once they are exceeded by
        encounter that we get a glimpse of His true glory.

      <h1>《&nbsp;IDENTITY COMPONENTS&nbsp;》</h1>
      <p>
        To continue with the firework concept, much of the other graphic
        elements of this series borrow from the visual language of film, which
        constantly manipulates and captures light. Text had blur and scale
        effects applied to simulate a more analog film feeling, while light
        leaks and other film artifacts subtly reemphasize the reference.
      </p>
      <h1>「&nbsp;Typography&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        For a visual system with so much dynamic movement, effects, and moving
        parts, Helvetica felt like the right choice for something solid,
        legible, and space-saving.
      </p>
      <img class="MED" src="img/18_Unexpected/UJ_006_fonts.png" />
      <h1>「&nbsp;Color&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        As general guidance, text was always white or black (on light
        backgrounds), as reference to the more straightforward setting of text
        on analog film. Colors should only be used in firework graphics, as
        applied to outer glows to blurred/white vectors.

      />
      <h1>「&nbsp;Fireworks&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        Fireworks were based on vector shapes that are puckered or bloated with
        various light effects, then layered to make a glowing explosion.
      </p>

      <h1>《&nbsp;WEEKLY TITLES&nbsp;》</h1>
      <p>
        The hero deliverable of this series was a series of animated sermon
        titles I made, envisioned as an eight-part fireworks display. Each
        weeks' theme was expressed through Noun-project icons, then manipulated
        into explosion in After Effects.

        Since services were still virtual, each of these animated titles played
        before the sermon began. They were followed by a held still which
        included a short artist's statement, with ghosted versions of the
        original icons.
      </p>
      <h1>「&nbsp;Other Deliverables&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        As part of the sermon identity, I also included guidance for various
        video aspects of Virutal Worship for the length of the series. This
        included overlays for different sections of worship, transitions for
        some planned "video testimonies," overlaid sermon graphics, and a
        template for social media. <br /><br />

        media assets.

      <h1>《&nbsp;CLOSING THOUGHTS&nbsp;》</h1>
      <p>
        This series visually captured many references I'd been holding onto for
        years—
        <br /><br />
        From a work perspective, It's probably my most motion-heavy project yet.
        I learned a ton about After Effects—watching many tutorials and refining
        my technique until I could animate the weekly titles in about an hour
        and a half. I also quickly learned the limits of my computer's memory :/
        <br /><br />
        At the end of hte day, there are many things i'm rpoud of from this
        project. The newness of techniques I discovered in Illustrator and After
        Effects… the way the rest of the identitiy fell into place around the
        medium of light the conceptual depth inr eferences I'd held onto for
        years.
        <br /><br />
        Often with church work, I've wondered if there will be a point where
        I've exhausted all of my creativity and I'm unable to summon something
        truly fresh and living. At what point might I develop an "indiivudal
        style," or start mindlessly replicating the same techniques—only with
        new typefaces and colors? In that way, this series felt like a return to
        inspired form. New techniques in Illustrator and After effects, an
        ambitious set of weekly deliverables… and a broader (yet tighter) visual
        system were a process full not just of learning, but of new and lviing
        energy.
        <br /><br />
        I've realized that when I visit museums, or even consume media—I'm
        constantly mentally bookmarking references for inspiration. This was one
        of the cases where it felt like the stars aligned and just the right
        references came through. Over the course of a few brainstorm meetings I
        began to write notes… which ultimately coalesced into final form.
        <br /><br />
        Thus, at its atomic level the series could be a celebration of Jesus
        <i>and</i> us. That which connects him to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,
        Peter, and the Samaritan Woman is offered freely to us. Our
        preconceptions can only burst open as old wineskins, yet expectantly as
        a tearing of the curtain, fireworks in teh background of a romantic
        comeday. And now, standing above th ewreckage of our tidy, domestic shed
        is Him with face radiant, to offer us all the terrifying and cathartic
        depth of a reationship with the living God—the living <i>God</i> who
        beckons us dance with the same power that created the universe and now
        somehow burns our hearts. The Unexpected Jesus loves us.
