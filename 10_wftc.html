      <h1 class="title">Words from the Cross</h1>
      <p>
        Entering the Lenten season of 2019 Church of the City examined the seven
        last phrases spoken by Jesus during his crucifixion. Each phrase was
        typeset in a concrete poetry style, descending from a cross towards a
        figurative "Golgoltha" below.

      <h1><b> 《 Intent and Inspiration 》</b></h1>

      <p>
        Since this series was so focused on words, I thought it most appropriate
        to focus any visualization on them. Each of these passages are repeated
        every Good Friday and thus familiar to most Christians. With all the
        ceremony, candles and acoustic music, it's easy for them to fade into
        the average buzz of ritual and religion—yet they originated at great
        cost, during the darkest point of Jesus' life on earth. What did they
        sound like? How were they spoken? How did it feel?

      <h1>「&nbsp;Inspiration 1: Calligrammes&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        While paging through Idea magazine a few weeks before I'd discovered a
        set of concrete poems by French Writer Guillaume Appolinnaire. He made
        them after surviving World War I and a shrapnel wound to his temple,
        while in recovery.
        <br /><br />
        The placement of leters in each poem create images—forming curls and
        fountains. Each letter looks carefully hand-placed, as an extension of
        the poetic form. My favorite of these series was <i>Il pleut</i>, where
        the letters form glittering raindrop, falling from the poem's title
        (strong inspiration for week 4's "I thirst"). <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>「&nbsp;Inspiration 2: Concrete Poetry&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        Beyond Appolinnaire, I discovered that many forms of concrete poetry
        have religious roots. Traditional <i>Shiviti,</i> plaques placed before
        cantor of a synagogue, functioned as textual and graphic centers for
        meditation on the name of God, often featuring a lampstand-formed
        version of Psalm 67. In the Christian tradtiion one of the early
        examples of English concrete poetry is George Herbert's
        <i>Easter Wings</i>, which meditates on the atonement of Christ in a
        poem set sideways in a wing-like form. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>「&nbsp;Inspiration 3: John Warwicker&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        A more contemporary inspiration is designer John Warwicker's book
        <i>Ukiyo-e:The Floating World</i>. With a delicate hand, Warwicker uses
        various sizes, compositions, and glyphs of Caslon to create a sublimely
        visual work of poetry. A TA I'd met at RISD called this book "everything
        you need to learn about layouts and composition." <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>「&nbsp;Inspiration 4: Kinetic Typography&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        A final reference was certain kinds of kinetic typography. I'd been
        listening to some of XXXtentacion's music after his passing, and really
        enjoyed some of the grungy aspects of his lyric video with Lil Pump /
        Maluma & Swae Lee on "Arms Around You"
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1><b> 《 Final Approach + Components 》</b></h1>
      <br /><br />

      <p>
        The final visual design attempts to capture each final word in a raw,
        living state. Every phrase is shown in type only, following a careful
        descent to earth from the cross. Words are kept relatively small and
        placed on textured backgrounds. Perhaps eyes straining ot read the words
        could mimic ears straining ot hear Jesus amidst the dark clamor of
        crucifixion.
        <br /><br />
        <img class="MED dotbord" src="img/10_wftc/wftc_05_step1.png" />
        <u>01. Courier (Words)</u> <br />As mentioned, words were intended as
        the hero of this series. I chose Courier for its simple practicality,
        and for its ability to focus attention on the expression of words over
        replicable perfection (this is hwy monospace is favored by writers.).
        Punctuation was exaggerated to emphasize the spoken nature of each
        phrase. <br /><br /><br />
        <img class="MED dotbord" src="img/10_wftc/wftc_06_step2.png" />
        <u>02. The Cross (icon) </u> <br />I generally try to avoid using
        crosses in a church design context, since they are so overused… but in
        this case, I thought it amde sense to give the words an origin point. I
        kept it small and stylized to make it a sort of punctuation glyph,
        undistracting from the text. I introduced a slight imperfection to its
        symmetry to acknowledge its organic imperfection. <br /><br /><br />
        <img class="MED dotbord" src="img/10_wftc/wftc_07_step3.png" />
        <u>03. Golgotha (background) </u> <br />The texture is meant to provide
        context for the words suggest a landscape reminiscent of Golgotha—the
        place Jesus was crucified (also called Calvary in more English
        traditions). Each "landscape" is created based off photos of olivewood,
        cypress, and pine planks—woods some Christians believe formed the One
        True Cross. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1><b> 《 PROCESS AND DELVIERABLES 》</b></h1>

      <p>
        As a sermon series, I was responsible for a variety of supporting assets
        including
        <br />&#9758; Cover slides for each week <br />&#9758; Corresponding
        social media assets, <br />&#9758; Presentation template for sermon
        slides <br />&#9758; Weekly bulletins/handouts.

        <br /><br />Bulletins were riso-printed at SVA's risolab in editions of
        700. Having just come off the This Must Be Stronger Than That series, I
        wanted to avoid some of the weekly production sprints and thus designed,
        printed, and cut the series in two larger batches. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>「&nbsp;Special Services&nbsp;」</h1>

      <p>
        Since this was a Lenten series, it officially started with an Ash
        Wednesday service and ended on Easter Sunday. To keep the experience
        continuous, I designed two extra cover slides with the same visual
        inspiration.
        <br /><br />
        The Easter Sunday handout came with a stronger call to action on the
        back, intended as both an invite and follow-up piece.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>《 CLOSING THOUGHTS&nbsp;》</h1>

      <p>
        The last series I'd designed before this was full of color, testing the
        limits of what could be called a visual system and taking full advantage
        of Risograph printing's vibrancy. This series stood in stark
        contrast—intensely dark and yet still using the tactility of riso
        printing to great effect.
        <br /><br />
        If I'm really honest, there was a small part of me that was terrified
        coming out of the last series. I felt like I had exercised every
        capability of design I had left—would I have any ideas left? The final
        process and execution of this series was a small miracle.
        <br /><br />
        John Warwicker's book was one of my first "Holy Grail" design books, and
        inspired my first book design at RISD. It felt good to come back to this
        poetic style of typesetting with a few years of extra maturity and
        restraint.
        <br /><br />
        All told, I still feel like this was a strong idea. The blend of white
        words on a dark landscape felt appropriate—final glitters of light that
        emerged in the cosmological darkness. It felt restrained enough to be
        clear, but sophisticated. I still feel like they might look even cooler
        animated.
