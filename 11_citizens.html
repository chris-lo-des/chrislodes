      <p>
        Citizens was a sermon series was based on 1 Peter's concept of
        "Christian citizenship"—one rooted in the "living hope" of Christ, that
        promised imperishable spiritual reward to a church alienated and
        oppressed in its Roman-empire context.
        <br /><br />
        Drawing inspiration from the US citizenship application and artists like
        Jenny Holzer, I developed a system of digital brushes and graphics that
        reproduce elements of the USCIS N-400 form (first form in the US
        Citizenship process). By turning these formal elements into expressive
        marks, the final designs connote the organic order that characterizes
        spiritual citizenship—one qualified by Divine Authority and living hope,
        rather than bureacracy and due process.

      <h1>《&nbsp;Weekly Covers&nbsp;》</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Each week's cover slide contained similar visual elements: "Citizens" as
        the series title, a page number that changed each week, several "form"
        element-marks, and the sermon title written cursive (the line borrowed
        from proportions of the N-400's' divider lines. Background colors were
        inspired by the pastels tones of office paper. I've put the five cover
        slides I designed below.

        As part of a weekly process, these compositions would be made in
        addition to several social media assets and an animated video bumper
        which preceded sermon recordings on the church's Youtube channel. I
        worked with fellow Design Team member Jessie Haedrick to make the weekly
        assets, and also created a companion sermon template for the teaching
        staff at church.

        Later versions of this bumper evolved into a more complex animation I
        developed with Creative Team Leader (and former animator) Christen
        Smith. We added some real dust and scratches to give more of a scanned
        feeling to the animation, and added a line draw to emphasize the
        hand-drawn nature of the text.

      <h1>《&nbsp;Inspiration: Holzer and "Government Formal"&nbsp;》</h1>

      <p>
        One of my first meaningful encounters with Jenny Holzer's work was at an
        exhibition at Mass MOCA in West Adams, MA. A room of the rotating
        exhibit at the time featured oil-painting reproductions of declassified
        government documents, including censored handprints, frank approvals of
        torture techniques, and powerpoint slides which had been shown to
        President Bush. It had been Holzer's hope that her platform and process
        as an artist might bring some of these hidden documents into spotlight.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <div class="bento LRG">
        <img class="HALF" src="img/11_citizens/citizens_07.jpg" />
        <img class="HALF" src="img/11_citizens/citizens_08.jpg" />
      </div>
      <div class="minispacer"></div>
      <p>
        <br />
        Holzer takes little artistic license with these reproductions, knowing
        their power is in her faithfulness to each and every detail. The
        "undesign" of government documents is often the subject of parody, yet
        here its exact visual language lends a kind of sinister credibility. In
        other words, it is <i>exactly</i> the formal appearance of each document
        that makes these paintings strong. This visual style has become
        associated with the American government's authority and power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians believe in a form of government higher still, ordered in the
        heaven by divine purpose and appointment. To appropriate the trappings
        of an earthly government gestures towards the basis of Spiritual
        Citizenship—a government with authority on power "on the shoulders" of
        God the Son.
      </p>

      <h1>｢&nbsp;Appropriating Formality&nbsp;｣</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The "government style" is not all that hard to dissect. U.S. passports
        are clad in navy linen, with classic serif faces and a golden seal. Most
        government forms use a crowd-pleasing Times New Roman and are packed
        full of text, lines, boxes, and numbering systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I did some more research on citizenship on the US, I quickly landed
        on the USCIS N-400 form as basis for visual exploration. I set about
        replicating various elements in Illustrator, and experimenting with
        different ways of imitating the government style. Since I didn't want to
        aligned it <i>too</i> closely with the government, I decided to take out
        references like various seals, and opted for a simplified version of the
        form.
      </p>
      <img class="MED" src="img/11_citizens/n400 screenshot.png" />

      <h1>｢&nbsp;Living Citizenship&nbsp;｣</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        1 Peter's describes the basis of Christian citizenship as "living hope,"
        Christians themselves as "living stones," and these stones as chosen and
        precious to God. For all of its power and authority, Spiritual
        Citizenship is by all accounts of a different nature in everything but
        name. How would one show this difference?
        <br /><br />
        As I continued to experiment I discovered art brushes, a nifty function
        of Illustrator that lets anyone create a custom brush with some drag and
        drop. By converting the N-400 form into a brush, the forms can now "come
        alive," freed from vector format into something richer and ripe for all
        kinds of experimentation.
        <br /><br />
        There was something primal feeling about the animation of these forms.
        To take something so strongly associated with bureacracy and boredom and
        transform it into lively, personable marks felt like a small-scale
        resurrection. As inspiration, I began examining inspirations from
        children's handwriting and rudimentary tools. At RISD, we'd constantly
        been taught the value of markmaking and mark-making tools as integral to
        the character of writing. The primacy of a legible-but-not-perfect
        cursive felt like a refreshing, living contrast to the more stolid
        character of Time New Roman and other graphic elements.
        <br /><br />

      <div class="minispacer"></div>
      <p>
        <br />
        The final system is based on a simplified version of the N-400 form,
        with most elements converted to brushes and a few more conventional
        graphic elements. Each week, a new composition wasbe composed by hand,
        encouraging an inconsistent and human touch to each.

      <h1>《&nbsp;Closing Thoughts&nbsp;》</h1>

      <p>
        The concept for this series seemed to fall togetgher pretty quickly. The
        flow from Citizenship to Holzer/Government forms to art brushes came
        together in a few hours of desk research, but it was actually the
        experimentation of brushes, compositions, and layouts that seemed most
        finnicky. I thought handwriting was pretty intuitive, but spent many
        hours drawing and redrawing rs interesting enough, but not too illegible
        <br /><br />
        This was one of the first projects that I animated each week. It was
        terrifying as a relative beginner in After Effects, but formed some of
        the foundation for later, motion-focused projects like Unexpected Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part was maybe that initial, hours-long flash of
        inspiration that came. I feel like it doesn't usually happen that
        easily, but this was one of the rare cases where the first idea was more
        or less fit for the job. As a project, it's not often one can play with
        intentionally boring design, and I was proud of how I managed to find a
        final process that felt so clearly referential without losing freshness.
