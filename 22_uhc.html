      <h1 class="title MED">UHC E&I Sales</h1>

      <p>
        UHC provides healthcare coverage to roughly 1 in 3 Americans, and its
        sales and account teams are the frontline of this service. Facing
        pressure from an increasingly dynamic market, SYPartners was hired by
        UHC’s Employer & Individual (E&I) business to help them better support
        UHC’s mission by enhancing their sales culture.
      </p>

      <h1>《&nbsp;Project Context&nbsp;》</h1>
      <p>
        With a new AT&T Purpose codified over the end of 2021, SYPartners was
        asked by Chief Marketing and Growth Officer Kellyn Smith Kenny and CEO,
        John Stankey to develop a series of innovative new products/offerings. These offerings were meant to bring AT&T's new purpose to life while helping drive drive 
        revenue growth, customer/employee retention, and overall greater efficiency within the organization.
        <br /><br />
        SYP and AT&T gathered five cross-functional teams from across the
        enterprise to participate in a multi-week series of "sprints" which
        included virtual speaker sessions and workshops, user interviews, an
        in-person prototyping session, and preliminary prototype testing. The
        work culminated in a series of video "pitches" filmed and reviewed by
        external and internal advisors. Selected projects would be awarded, celebrated, and
        earmarked for resourcing and rollout within the company.

      <h1>《&nbsp;Visual Context&nbsp;》</h1>
      <p>
        AT&T is an old company, and a lot of the challenges we encountered were
        based around building belief rather than necessarily time or resources. 
        Time and time again, we heard warnings that the ideas
        might not be great, or that AT&T employees were "generally uncreative."
        Good ideas were far and few between, risk appetite was low, and many
        employees didn't feel safe to brainstorm and toss ideas at the wall in
        an environment where every idea needed to be backed up with exhaustive
        research and robust financial modelling. Further than this, creativity
        itself was a mode of working which seemed entirely foreign to many of
        our participants, who were nominated from around the organization. Many
        thus entered the process with a little past experience and more than a
        little trepidation around whether their boss (and CEO) would approve of
        their performance.
        <br /><br />
        The sum total of these influences meant that every aspect of the Sprints
        would need to be designed to signal creative looseness and safety in a
        marked departure from stodgy business-as-usual. We wantede to move away
        from the typical environment of AT&T's internal, tightly-aligned
        corporate style, to something that felt unrefined, organic, and
        imperfect in reflection of the true creative process.<br /><br />

      <h1>《&nbsp;Concept: Blind Contour Drawings&nbsp;》</h1>
      <p>
        The solution came in concert with some of the experience design we were
        doing around the first sprint. As we realized many of these teammates
        had never met, we needed to plan a short and efficient exercise for
        introductions. We quickly turned back to one of SYP's classic intro
        exercises: doing blind contour drawings of a partner where you don't
        look at the page while you draw, and try to do the full drawing in a
        single line. In drawing class, this is meant as an exercise in
        observation and economy of line; in a corporate context, we found it a
        wonderful way to familiarize yourself with a new face, while encouraging
        a fun and imperfect mode of creation.
        <br /><br />
        As we thought more about it we realized that this initial exercise of
        blind contour drawing could be likened to the Sprint process itself. In
        a moment of immense change, facing a bevy of internal and external
        pressures, AT&T was looking to do something future-facing with little
        visibility ahead. Just like contour drawings—meant to be cheap and
        gestural creations—the signatures themselves were meant to be quick and
        fast "sketches" of new, company-defining work.

        Initial compositions (above) were a bit looser, with a bit of an
        abstract composition. As we considered scale and speed, some of the
        higher-work ideas were abandoned in favor of styles that allowed for
        quick and efficient composition. Thus later iterations used solid shapes
        with bright, off-primary colors.

      <p>
        <br />
        The final direction took a little more care with each illustration,
        while still using basic shapes and colors (at client request) more
        aligned to AT&T Brand. Each shape also functioned as a color-identity
        for its corresponding sprint, meaning the sketches could be used both as
        cover illustration <i>and</i> icon. <br /><br />
        Execution of all final deliverables stemmed from this exploration, using
        only elements of sketch, type, and colored shape.<br /><br />
